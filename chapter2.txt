life shows no mercy 
every day we wake up trying to make a difference in ourselves....and after we give a shit tonn of effort
life smiles on us and we taste the the sweet brown chocolate fudge of success,but and afer the 1st bite 
when you look for second, you vomit at the the smell of  shit just below the sweet taste of chocolate.
the smile of a careing mother turns into the smile of a deceitful witch .
